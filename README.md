# Pneumonia Detection


## Pneumonia detection by classification of Chest X-ray Images.

Dataset can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Requirements to run this code: 

Tensorflow >= 2.0, OpenCV, Streamlit, Numpy

Made a web application in streamlit where you can upload Chest X-ray Image to check what is the model's prediction

To run this web application, download the code, check all the requirements and run:

#### streamlit run pneumonia_detection_webapp.py

The model is trained to achieve ~92% Train accuracy and ~93% Test accuracy
